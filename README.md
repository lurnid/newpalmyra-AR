#  New Palmyra AR

The aim of this project is to use the models developed for [New Palmyra](https://newpalmyra.org/) to build AR tours of the monuments. 

I've initially used the model of the [Arch of Triumph](https://www.newpalmyra.org/models/arch-of-triumph/).

Please connect / submit a PR if you'd like to make any of the other models AR-ready or enhance the functionality. It's still pretty basic right now!

*Note*: You'll need to use [git-lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) to track any files larger than 100MB

Instructions:
* Clone the repo
* Open in XCode
* Make sure your phone is connected to XCode. Wifi connection is preferred because no wires :)
* Run on your phone from XCode
* When the app launches, point it at a suitable surface and tap the screen for the model to appear. If you don't like we're it's ended up, tap the model to remove it from the view, point your camera somewhere else and tap on the screen again. Repeat as necessary.
* Happy tapping and welcome to the #palmyraverse!
